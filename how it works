1. Connect the SIM800i module to the ESP8266 board according to the manufacturer's instructions.

2. Connect the button to the ESP8266 board. You can use a digital input pin on the ESP8266 to detect button presses and trigger an event.

3. Write code to detect button presses using the digitalRead() function in the Arduino IDE.

4. When the button is pressed, send a message to the SIM800i module to send an SMS to a designated phone number. You can use the AT commands provided by the SIM800i module to send an SMS.

5. In addition to sending an SMS, you can also trigger a buzzer to sound. You can connect a buzzer to one of the digital output pins on the ESP8266 and write code to turn it on and off when the button is pressed.
